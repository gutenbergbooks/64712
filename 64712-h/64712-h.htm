<div class="gapshortdoubleline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; In tracing the origin of the Branch Museum of Science
and Art at Bethnal Green it will be necessary to refer, though
briefly, to the early days of the parent institution, at South
Kensington, from whence a considerable portion of the new edifice
and of its contents have been derived.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The South Kensington Museum stands on 12 acres of
land, acquired by the Government at a cost of 60,000<i>l.</i>,
being a portion of the estate purchased by Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851, out of the surplus
proceeds of that undertaking.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Here, in 1855, a spacious building was constructed,
chiefly of iron and wood, under the superintendence of the late
Sir William Cubitt, C.E., at a cost of 15,000<i>l.</i>, intended
to receive several miscellaneous collections of a scientific
character mainly acquired from the Exhibition of 1851, and which
had been temporarily housed in various places.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; In addition to the collections already alluded to,
the whole of the Fine Art collections which had been exhibited at
Marlborough House since 1852 were also removed thither, and these
were supplemented by numerous and valuable loans by Her Majesty
the Queen and others.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; This building was opened on June 22nd, 1857, as <span
class="smcap">The South Kensington Museum</span>.&nbsp; Although
in many respects well suited to its purpose, this iron building
was avowedly of a temporary character, and from the first it was
intended to replace it by buildings of a more architectural
character and of more substantial materials.&nbsp; The erection
of these permanent buildings was commenced at once, and at the
beginning of the year 1865 sufficient progress had been made to
render the removal of the iron building necessary.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>VI.&nbsp;
It appeared to the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education
that &ldquo;this iron building might usefully be divided into
three portions, and that one of these portions might be offered
to the proper authorities in the north, east, and south of London
respectively, at a nominal sum, in order to assist in the
formation of district museums, security being required for the
completion of each portion in a suitable manner, and for its
permanent appropriation to public uses.&rdquo;&nbsp; After some
correspondence with other Departments of the Government, it was
decided that measures should be taken for carrying out this
proposal.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; On May 6, 1865, a meeting of noblemen and gentlemen
interested in the establishment of Suburban or Metropolitan
District Museums was held at the South Kensington Museum, the
Lord President of the Council, Earl Granville, being in the
chair, at which the proposal was fully discussed, and a strong
desire was expressed by the representatives of the various
suburban districts of the north, east, and south of London to
secure a share of this building, the great difficulty felt in
each case being the providing of a suitable site.&nbsp; It was
decided that after a period of six months each district should be
at liberty to put in its claim to a portion of the iron building,
and send its application to the Science and Art Department.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; On March 7th in the following year (1866) Mr. now
Sir Antonio Brady addressed the following letter to the Lord
President of the Council:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">Stratford, E., 7 March
1866.</p>
<p>May it please your Lordship,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I and others acting with me
had the honour of attending the meeting held under your
Lordship&rsquo;s presidency, in the Lecture Room of South
Kensington Museum, on the 6th May last, on the subject of Local
Metropolitan Museums, I put in a plea on behalf of the million
artisans inhabiting the densely populated manufacturing and
labouring districts in the East of London; and I pointed to a
site most admirably placed in the very centre of the East-end,
which I then hoped might be made available for the proposed
museum.</p>
<p>The land in question, containing about 4&frac12; acres, is
close to Mile-end Station, one mile from Shoreditch on the Great
Eastern Railway; it is near the junction of the Hackney and
Cambridge Heath Roads, and is the centre of a network of
railways, and omnibuses run in all directions, at twopenny and
threepenny fares to and from all parts of London.</p>
<p>The site is about one mile and three quarters from the Bank of
England, and two miles from the General Post Office, and taking
the proposed site as a centre, within a radius of two miles are
comprised a <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>large portion of the following extensive districts, viz.:
City of London, Shoreditch, Finsbury, St. Luke&rsquo;s, Old
Street, Hoxton, Islington, De Beauvoir Town, Canonbury,
Ball&rsquo;s Pond, Kingsland, Dalston, Clapton, Homerton,
Hackney, Victoria Park, Old Ford, Bow, Stepney, Limehouse, Poplar
(including West India Docks), parts of Rotherhithe and Bermondsey
(including Surrey and Commercial Docks), Shadwell, Wapping, St.
George&rsquo;s-in-the-East (including London and St.
Katharine&rsquo;s Docks), Tower, Whitechapel, and Mile-end.</p>
<p>This circle of two miles radius embraces the N.E. and E.
postal districts, part of the N. district, and parts of the E.C.
and S.E. districts.</p>
<p>The land in question was bought as a gift to the poor in King
James&rsquo;s reign, when this part of London was open fields,
and the trustees, with the consent of the Charity Commissioners,
have unanimously agreed to sell the land for the purposes of the
proposed museum, and to invest the purchase-money, which has been
conditionally offered and accepted.</p>
<p>I have now the pleasure of informing your Lordship that, if
this site is acceptable to the Government, I am authorised, on
the part of the committee acting with me, to guarantee to raise
the purchase-money necessary to acquire the fee simple, and to
offer this magnificent site to the Government for the purpose of
erecting thereon a museum for the East-end of London.</p>
<p>The site is marked red in the accompanying maps, and is more
particularly described in the plan hereunto annexed; it will be
seen that it occupies a most commanding position.&nbsp; There is
no other suitable spot unbuilt on, but if we had the choice of
any ground in the East-end we should recommend the position of
this site in preference to any other.</p>
<p>It is not my purpose to enter on the advantages of local
museums.&nbsp; After what passed at the meeting at South
Kensington, the value of institutions such as we wish to see
established in the East-end is admitted on all hands; but what I
desire respectfully to submit to your Lordship is the kind of
museum which those acting with me would wish to see erected.</p>
<p>During the past year the subject of local museums has been
much ventilated, and as the time has now arrived when it seems a
necessity to provide more room for the great national
collections, we respectfully submit that it is a good and fitting
opportunity to make the national collections more useful and more
accessible than they now are, and I trust this splendid site may
induce the Government to entertain the propositions I have the
honour to submit for their consideration.</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; From inquiries made since the meeting last May, it
is found that it will be utterly and entirely impracticable for a
permanent building to be erected by local efforts, or to maintain
the necessary staff if a building were otherwise provided; and we
feel that this could only efficiently be done by the Government
as a part of one comprehensive scheme.&nbsp; We find it will
require all our efforts to raise the funds to pay for the site,
and under these circumstances we humbly submit to your Lordship
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>that the
Government should, in exchange for the site, take the whole
matter into their own hands as a national affair.</p>
<p>2ndly.&nbsp; The scheme that commends itself most to our minds
is, not to distribute the superfluities of the British Museum
<i>piecemeal</i> amongst several local museums, but that typical
collections illustrating one branch of science should be arranged
in one of several museums in different quarters of the
metropolis.&nbsp; The British Museum would thus be relieved of
its plethora without impairing the value of any one collection;
for instance, the natural history collections may be kept
together in one place, the ethnological in another, so that
anyone requiring to study any particular branch would know to
what museum to resort.</p>
<p>In any plan of a museum that may be adopted for the
improvement of the working classes, we submit that if they are to
benefit by it to the fullest extent, it must be placed in a
neighbourhood accessible to them, and must be open of an
evening.&nbsp; We submit that it be made <i>educational in the
widest sense of the word</i>, and that convenient and comfortable
refreshment-rooms be added to the other attractions of the
place.</p>
<p>I am to request that your Lordship will be pleased to
communicate your wishes in this matter, that we, on our part, may
at once take the necessary means to give legal effect to this
arrangement, if concurred in by your Lordship.</p>
<p>The land being unoccupied would be available immediately the
preliminary agreements were finally settled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I have, &amp;c.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Signed) Antonio Brady, J.P.,<br />
<i>Honorary Secretary</i>.</p>
<p>To the Right Honourable Earl Granville, K.G., Lord President
of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Most Honourable Privy Council.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IX.&nbsp; This letter was at once taken into favourable
consideration by the Lords of the Committee of Council on
Education, Earl Granville and Mr. Bruce being respectively
President and Vice-President.&nbsp; A change of Government
shortly afterwards took place which caused some delay, but on
December 6, 1866, the Duke of Buckingham being President and Mr.
Corry Vice-President, a minute was passed recommending the
proposal to the favourable consideration of the Lords
Commissioners of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury, and asking that an
estimate of the probable cost might be included in the votes of
the ensuing year.&nbsp; The following paragraph occurs in this
minute:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Lords regret that Mr. Brady&rsquo;s
offer on behalf of Bethnal Green can be adduced as the sole proof
of the practical earnestness of the several districts of the
metropolis to act in establishing district museums.&nbsp; Their
Lordships, therefore, propose <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>that the iron columns, flooring,
stairs, window fittings, heating arrangements, &amp;c. of the
whole of the iron building should be re-erected as soon as
practicable at Bethnal Green, on the free site provided by the
locality, but that brick walls and a slate roof should be used
instead of iron; and they estimate that the cost will be
20,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; The works would thus be of a permanent
nature.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>X.&nbsp; The Treasury (the Right Hon. B. Disraeli being then
Chancellor of the Exchequer) accepted the proposal to re-erect
the structure and to provide for its maintenance, and a vote of
5,000<i>l.</i> on account was granted by the House of Commons
towards the cost of removal and re-erection of the building, but
some delay arose in consequence of legal difficulties as to the
conveyance of the ground.&nbsp; By the untiring efforts of Sir
Antonio Brady, the Rev. Septimus Hansard, rector of Bethnal
Green, Mr. J. M. Clabon, Dr. J. Millar, and others, heartily
seconded by the trustees of the land and supported by the
Government, these difficulties were at length surmounted, a
special Act of Parliament having been obtained for the purpose
(31 Vict. c. 8.), and on 13 February 1869, the four gentlemen
above named, acting on behalf of the subscribers to the fund for
the purchase of the site, attended at the Council Chamber,
Downing Street, and presented to the Lord President and
Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education the
title-deeds of the site. <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>XI.&nbsp; After the removal of the materials had taken place
the erection of the building was at once commenced in accordance
with plans prepared for the Department of Science and Art under
the direction of Major-General Scott, C.B.</p>
<p>XII.&nbsp; At the beginning of the present year (1872) the
building was sufficiently advanced for the reception of
objects.&nbsp; Two important collections, formerly exhibited in
the iron buildings, already existed in the South Kensington
Museum ready for transfer to Bethnal Green, the <span
class="smcap">Animal Products Collection</span> intended to
illustrate the various applications of animal substances to
industrial purposes, and the <span class="smcap">Food
Collection</span>, one of the most popular divisions of the
Museum.&nbsp; These, with an important series of examples of
Economic Entomology recently formed by Mr. Andrew Murray, now
occupy the whole of the space on the ground floor under the
galleries, and it is confidently <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>believed that they will prove of great
and abiding interest and educational value, forming as they do no
inconsiderable contribution towards the establishment of a
complete trade museum, the necessity for which at the East-end of
the metropolis has long been recognised.</p>
<p>XIII.&nbsp; The galleries of the building on the first floor
are at present assigned to Paintings and other Fine Art objects,
and the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education are
indebted to the generous liberality of Sir Richard Wallace,
Bart., for the loan of a collection of Art Treasures of almost
unexampled beauty and value, occupying the whole of the space
assigned to this division.&nbsp; These Art Treasures, collected
by the late Marquis of Hertford, K.G., during a period of 30
years, have hitherto been comparatively unknown to the English
public, a large portion of the objects having been specially
brought over from Paris within the last three months at the
expense of Sir Richard Wallace.</p>
<p>XIV.&nbsp; The basement of the building contains a range of
spacious and well-lighted rooms.&nbsp; A portion of this will
serve as Refreshment Rooms, and it is proposed to use the
remainder for educational purposes, including a Library, and
rooms in which classes may receive instruction in the various
branches of Science and Art.</p>
<p>XV.&nbsp; It was desired by Her Majesty the Queen that on the
24th June 1872 the Museum should be opened in state by His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales on behalf of Her Majesty, the Prince
being accompanied by Her Royal Highness the Princess of
Wales.</p>

<h2>A BRIEF GUIDE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO</span><br />
THE FOOD COLLECTION. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a></h2>
<p class="gutindent"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>An
Inventory of the Collection</i>, <i>arranged alphabetically</i>,
<i>and containing fuller information than this Guide</i>, <i>can
be obtained at the Catalogue Stall</i>, <i>Price
Sixpence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> idea of the Food Collection
(originally formed in 1857), now removed from the South
Kensington Museum and arranged in the lower Gallery on the North
side of the Branch Museum at Bethnal Green was suggested by
Thomas Twining, Esq., of Twickenham, as part of a plan for the
establishment of an Economic Museum that should comprise
illustrations of every-day life for the working classes.&nbsp;
The Food Collection was at the commencement of its formation
carried on under the direction of Dr. Lyon Playfair, M.P., and,
as now constituted, has been arranged with the express object of
teaching the nature and sources of the food which rich and poor
alike need for the maintenance of their daily life.&nbsp;
Considerable progress has been made in carrying out this design,
and the present brief Guide is intended as an introduction to the
general principles and plan upon which the Collection has been
arranged.&nbsp; Two great objects have been kept in view in the
Collection:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, to represent the chemical compositions of the various
substances used as food; and, secondly, to illustrate the natural
sources from which the various kinds of food have been
obtained.&nbsp; Where the processes of the preparation of food
admit of illustration, these are also exhibited.</p>
<p>There are many methods by which such a Collection might be
arranged; but the Chemical Composition of Food has recently been
discovered to have so close a connexion with its action on the
system, that it has been deemed advisable to follow a <i>Chemical
arrangement</i>.&nbsp; All food is found to be composed of the
same materials or elements as the Human Body.&nbsp; The necessity
of the supply of food from day to day depends on the fact, that
the elements of the human body are daily wasted by the processes
of life.&nbsp; As a fire cannot <i>burn</i> without a supply of
<i>fuel</i>, neither can the human body <i>live</i> without its
daily supplies of <i>food</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Composition of the Human
Body</span>.</h3>
<p>Not only does food supply the daily waste of the human body,
but, as the body increases in size from birth to adult age, it is
supplied with materials for this increase by the aid of
food.&nbsp; In order, therefore, to understand the value of food
from its composition, it is necessary to know the composition of
the human body.&nbsp; Just as any other compound substance can be
submitted to chemical analysis and the elements of which it
consists ascertained, so can the composition of the human body be
discovered.&nbsp; Such analyses of course become difficult in
proportion to the complication of the body analysed, and only an
approach to the true quantities in which the elements exist can
be expected.&nbsp; In Case No. <b>1</b>, Division <b>A.</b>, the
results of such an analysis have been attempted, and the
quantities of each element entering into the composition of a
human body weighing 11 stone or 154 pounds are (as far as
possible) presented to the eye.</p>
<p>The following are the elements and their
quantities:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>An imperial gallon of water weighs</i> 10 <i>pounds
avoirdupois weight</i>.</p>
<p>Water for dietetical purposes is obtained principally from
three sources:&mdash;1. Rivers; 2. Surface wells; 3. Deep or
Artesian wells.&nbsp; Water from all three sources contains
saline or mineral matters in solution, and, provided they are not
in quantities so large as to act injuriously on the system, water
may become a source of supply of these constituents to the
body.&nbsp; The best remedy for impure water is filtering, which
may be done by passing the water through charcoal and sand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A Poor Man&rsquo;s Filter&rdquo; is exhibited in the
Museum, which can be very easily and cheaply constructed by using
a common flower-pot, glazed inside, plugging the drainage hole
(not too tightly) with a piece of clean sponge, then adding
layers of animal charcoal, sand, and rather coarse gravel.&nbsp;
Filters from the establishments of the Messrs. Lipscombe, the
Messrs. Ransome, and the Carbon Filter Company are also
exhibited.&nbsp; The passing water over iron has been found to
have a remarkably purifying effect, and this has been patented by
Dr. Medlock.</p>
<p>The <i>organic</i> impurities of water are best tested by the
aid of the microscope, but, as an examination by this instrument
requires much time, a ready method of obtaining a knowledge of
the comparative organic impurity of waters is the addition of the
permanganate of soda or potash.&nbsp; This salt, which gives to
water a beautiful red colour, is easily decomposed by organic
matters.&nbsp; When the same quantity of the permanganate is
added to a series of waters containing organic matters, those
which contain the least retain the most colour and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.&nbsp; Waters thus tested are exhibited in the
Collection.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Water
from the chalk or limestone is generally hard, arising from its
holding in solution carbonate of lime, which, although insoluble
in water, is dissolved by the agency of carbonic acid.&nbsp; By
Clark&rsquo;s softening process the carbonic acid is neutralized
by lime, and the carbonate of lime is thus thrown down.&nbsp;
Specimens are exhibited.</p>
<p>Water is frequently stored in leaden cisterns, and when free
from carbonic and phosphoric acids it acts powerfully on
lead.&nbsp; Thus distilled water becomes speedily tainted with
lead, whilst Thames water and London surface well water act but
slightly upon it.&nbsp; Specimens of these waters acting upon
lead are exhibited in the Collection.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Salt</span>.</h4>
<p>Common Salt is a chloride of sodium, and exerts an
extraordinary influence on animal as well as vegetable
life.&nbsp; All marine animals and plants seem to have their
existence determined by this substance.&nbsp; It enters into the
composition of the human body, and all over the world man uses
it, when he can obtain it, in its mineral form, as an addition to
his food.</p>
<p>In Case <b>5</b> will be seen a collection of salt from
various countries.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Minerals in Food</span>.</h4>
<p>In Case <b>4</b> are examples of some of the principal Mineral
Substances, excepting water, in food.&nbsp; They are generally
essential to proper nutrition.&nbsp; In the body of a man,
weighing 154 lbs., there are about 8 lbs. of mineral
matter.&nbsp; Different parts of the body show peculiar affection
for particular ingredients to the exclusion of others.&nbsp; The
mineral salts contained in plants and animals are indestructible
by heat, hence they are called &ldquo;ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should be recollected, that in the boiling of food many of
the mineral substances are dissolved out of it, and where the
liquid that they are boiled in is not consumed such mineral
matters are thrown away.&nbsp; This is the case with boiled meat
and vegetables, and a constant use of such food may lead to
injurious effects.&nbsp; The best corrective to such a diet is
the use of uncooked fruit and vegetables.&nbsp; In this way the
eating of ripe fruits, as apples, pears, gooseberries, &amp;c.,
and salads, has a beneficial effect on the system.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Salads</span>.</h4>
<p>Although many things eaten as salads contain other
constituents of food besides mineral matters their beneficial
action in diet is due to the latter.&nbsp; The practice of eating
salads is not so common in Europe as before the introduction of
the potato, which, to a certain extent, supplies the same kind of
mineral matters to the blood.&nbsp; The practice of eating salads
is, nevertheless, to be highly commended; and many plants
formerly much used might now be consumed in this way with much
advantage.&nbsp; Plants thus used contain a larger quantity of
mineral matter than vegetables which have been boiled in
water.&nbsp; Various plants used as salads may be seen on the
shelves, and are renewed from time to time.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Force-producers in Food</span>.</h4>
<p>In Case <b>4</b> may be seen the varieties of substances
called &ldquo;force-producers in food.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Starch</span>.</h4>
<p>The substance called Starch is found very abundantly in the
vegetable kingdom.&nbsp; Its presence was at one time regarded as
characteristic of plants, but it has recently been found in
animals.&nbsp; It occurs in the form of irregularly-shaped
granules, which vary in size from the 1/400 to the 1/2000-th of
an inch in diameter.&nbsp; These granules are simple or
compound.&nbsp; They vary in shape and size in every species of
plant, and are insoluble in water, but are easily diffused
through it.&nbsp; On being mixed with water, and exposed to a
temperature of 180&deg;, the starch gelatinises, and, mixing with
the water, thickens it.&nbsp; This occurs in the cooking of
starch, and this property lies at the foundation of pudding
making.</p>
<p>Starch is abundantly present in all the more common forms of
vegetable diet.&nbsp; Is exists in a state of almost absolute
purity in the substances known as arrowroot, tapioca, and
sago.&nbsp; These substances from whatever source obtained,
contain little or no nutritious or flesh-forming food, and,
consequently, ought never to become the substantive diet of human
beings.&nbsp; Many plants contain so large quantities of starch,
and so small quantities of flesh-forming matter, that they ought
only to be taken on account of their starch.&nbsp; Such are the
potato and rice, in which the quantity of starch to flesh-forming
matter is as 14 to 1, whilst in wheat it is only as 5 to 1.&nbsp;
Potatoes and rice, therefore, can never form the staple article
of the diet of the people of this country, who need a large
quantity of force-producing matter in order to enable them to
perform their work.</p>
<p>Starch is extensively used in the arts manufactures, and for
domestic purposes.&nbsp; It is prepared for this purpose from the
potato, wheat, rice, flour, and the coarser kinds of sago.</p>
<p>In Cases <b>6</b> and <b>16</b> is an extensive series of
starches, sago, arrowroot, tapioca, &amp;c. &amp;c., from various
parts of the world.</p>

times of scarcity the poorer inhabitants of the sea-shores of
Europe have recourse to sea-weeds for a supply of food.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Potato</span>.</h4>
<p>Although this plant contains but a small quantity of flesh and
force-producing matter, it yields an abundance of starch and
mineral matters in a condition which acts very beneficially on
the human system, and its introduction into Europe has been of
the greatest benefit to its teeming populations.</p>
<p>The potato is an herbaceous plant producing annual stems from
an underground tuber or root-stock which is the part that is used
as an article of food.&nbsp; It has white flowers and a green
fruit, which, like all the plants of the order to which it
belongs, contain a poisonous principle.&nbsp; The native country
of the plant is South America.&nbsp; It has been found wild in
various parts of Chili, and also near Monte Video, Lima, Quito,
Santa Fe de Bogota, and in Mexico.&nbsp; Spain was the country in
which this plant was first cultivated in Europe; from thence it
extended into Italy.&nbsp; It was first grown in the British
Islands by Sir Walter Raleigh in his garden at Youghal in
Ireland, but it was not generally cultivated in Great Britain
till the middle the last century.&nbsp; The only part of the
plant employed as food is the tuber, which is a kind of
underground stem.&nbsp; Upon this stem buds are formed which are
called &ldquo;eyes,&rdquo; and from these, by cutting up the
potato, the plant is propagated.&nbsp; The tubers of the wild
potato are small in size, but by culture they may be very much
enlarged.&nbsp; In this country many varieties of the potato are
known under the names of &ldquo;kidneys,&rdquo;
&ldquo;rounds,&rdquo; &ldquo;reds,&rdquo; &ldquo;blues,&rdquo;
&ldquo;whites,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Many of these varieties are
now disappearing, the &ldquo;white,&rdquo; &ldquo;kidney,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;round&rdquo; potatoes being preferred to all
others.&nbsp; The potato contains large quantities of water (75
per cent.), and less flesh and force-producing matters than any
other plant cultivated for human food.&nbsp; It is therefore not
adapted for consumption as a principal article of diet, and
should only be employed as an addition to more nutritious kinds
of food.&nbsp; It contains a variety of mineral matters, which
also render it valuable as an article of diet.&nbsp; It has for
many years been liable, in Europe, to a diseased condition, in
which the water seems to be increased, and decomposition
consequently readily sets in.&nbsp; The decayed parts are
infested by a fungus, but this has not been shown to have
anything to do with the production of the disease.&nbsp; Potatoes
are largely employed in this country for the production of
starch, which is used for a variety of purposes in the arts and
manufactures.&nbsp; Potatoes are cooked in many ways, and all the
varieties of food which can be obtained from the flour of the
cerealia may be procured from the potato, as starch, macaroni,
vermicelli, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The analysis of the Potato may be seen in Case <b>8</b>, as
well as various preparations from it.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Rice</span>.</h4>
<p>This plant belongs to the natural order of grasses.&nbsp; It
is a native of East India, and is extensively cultivated
throughout Asia, in North and South Carolina, and other parts of
the world.&nbsp; Although more largely consumed by the
inhabitants of the world than any other grain, it contains less
flesh and force-producing matter.</p>
<p>When employed in this country it should only be used as an
adjunct to other kinds of food more rich in
force-producers.&nbsp; Boiled, as an addition to meat, or in the
form of pudding or curry, it may be judiciously employed, as a
variety, especially in the food of the young.</p>
<p>Case <b>9</b> shows the analysis of rice, and many samples of
the grain are exhibited in the Collection.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Sugar</span>.</h4>
<p>Sugar has a chemical composition very nearly resembling
starch, but it differs in both chemical and physical
properties.&nbsp; Sugar is soluble in water, whilst starch is
only diffusible through it.&nbsp; Sugar undergoes the process of
fermentation, which starch does not.&nbsp; Sugar has a sweet
taste, while starch is almost tasteless.&nbsp; Starch is,
however, convertible into sugar by the agency of nitrogenous
substances.&nbsp; If starch is placed in contact with saliva a
little time it becomes soluble, and gives the reactions of sugar;
and it is probable that in this way starch itself becomes
absorbed into the <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>blood.&nbsp; Sugar, like starch, assumes various forms,
and three of these are found in common articles of diet.&nbsp;
These are cane sugar, grape sugar, and milk sugar.</p>
<p>The action of sugar on the system is identical with
starch.&nbsp; As it is more readily absorbed into the blood than
starch, it is better adapted as a force-producer for the
young.&nbsp; Hence it is found supplied to the young in all the
mammalia, in the milk secreted by their mothers.&nbsp; That it is
adapted for the young is shown by the instinctive propensity
children display to partake of this form of diet.&nbsp; Although
adapted for children, the facility with which it decomposes
renders it frequently injurious to adults.</p>
<p>Most plants contain sugar in their roots.&nbsp; But in some
large quantities are deposited, as in the sugar beet, which is
employed most extensively in France and on the continent of
Europe for the supply of sugar for dietetical purposes.&nbsp; A
series of specimens illustrating products from beet-root,
including sugar, from Messieurs Serret, Hamoir, and Co., of
Valenciennes, are exhibited in the Collection.</p>
<p>Sugar is the basis of all kinds of confectionery, specimens of
which are exhibited by Messrs. Fortnum and Mason, of Piccadilly,
in Case <b>111</b>.</p>
<p>Samples of sugar are exhibited in Cases <b>17</b>, <b>110</b>,
<b>112</b>, and <b>113</b>, some of which have obtained been from
other plants than the sugar cane.</p>
<p>Fruits after being saturated with sugar are also preserved and
kept dry.&nbsp; In Case <b>15</b> preserved fruits of various
kinds are exhibited by Messrs. Fortnum and Mason.&nbsp; It is in
this way that fruits are brought to this country which otherwise
would not be seen on account of their perishing nature.</p>
<p><i>Treacle</i> or <i>Molasses</i> is the uncrystallized
portion of sugar which is separated by draining from the brown
sugar.</p>
<p><i>Grape Sugar</i> or <i>Glucose</i> is found in the fruits of
plants, and is especially abundant in the grape.&nbsp; Grapes,
when dried, are eaten on account of the glucose they
contain.&nbsp; They are known in the shops under the name of
&ldquo;plums,&rdquo; &ldquo;raisins,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;currants.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter word is a corruption of
Corinth, the small grape yielding this, being cultivated in the
vicinity of Corinth, on the classic soil of Greece.</p>
<p>Dried fruits of the grape-vine, presented by Messrs. Fortnum
and Mason, Piccadilly, are exhibited in Case <b>14</b>.</p>
<p><i>Honey</i>, which is the stored food of the bee, contains
both crystallizable and uncrystallizable grape sugar.&nbsp; The
crystals of the former may be easily detected by the aid of a low
power of the microscope.&nbsp; Samples of British honey, and
honey from France, Russia, and other countries, may be seen in
Cases <b>18</b>.</p>
<p><i>Substances resembling Sugar</i>, such as dextrin, gum,
liquorice, manna, &amp;c., are exhibited in Case
<b>107</b>.&nbsp; Among plants yielding sugar may be noted the
Chinese sugar millet (Case <b>17</b>), sweet potato (Case
<b>8</b>), turnips (Case <b>11</b>), carrots (Case <b>11</b>),
and Jerusalem artichoke (Case <b>12</b>), the analyses of which
are exhibited.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Fat and Oil</span>.</h4>
<p>Under the names of oil, butter, fat, lard, suet, and grease, a
substance is used largely as an article of food, which differs
from starch and sugar in the absence of oxygen gas.&nbsp; The
composition of these oleaginous substances may be represented as
follows:&mdash;Carbon 11 parts; hydrogen 10 parts; oxygen 1
part.</p>
<p>Oil differs from the other carbonaceous substances in food in
not only supplying materials for maintaining animal heat, but in
forming a part of the tissues of the body called fat.&nbsp; The
quantity consumed in animal food is very large, constituting
frequently more than half of the bulk of the food consumed.&nbsp;
It is also found very generally present in the vegetable
substances used as food.&nbsp; Although essential as an article
of diet in certain quantities, oil is less digestible than other
kinds of food, and those foods which contain it in large
quantities are generally indigestible.&nbsp; The principal source
of oil used as food from the vegetable kingdom is the
Olive.&nbsp; This plant is cultivated in the south of
Europe.&nbsp; The part of the plant which contains the oil is the
fruit.&nbsp; The seeds of most plants contain oil in addition to
starch and other principles.&nbsp; Many seeds are used for
obtaining oil for various purposes in the arts, as the poppy,
rape, mustard, hemp, and flax seeds.&nbsp; In Case <b>20</b> is a
collection of nuts and seeds containing oil commonly eaten as
food.&nbsp; Case <b>21</b> contains the analysis of the coco-nut;
and in the same Case that of an African bread called &ldquo;Dika
bread,&rdquo; both of which illustrate food products containing
an abundance of oil.&nbsp; The cocoa, or chocolate plant, is one
of the most remarkable vegetable productions yielding oil, the
seeds giving nearly 50 per cent. of a hard oil, or butter.&nbsp;
See Case <b>53</b>.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Flesh and Force-producers</span>.</h4>
<p>In Case <b>4</b> are shown those ingredients of food, which
are capable of forming muscle or flesh.&nbsp; They are made use
of in the human body partly for the construction of muscle, and
partly for the production of mechanical force and heat.&nbsp;
They are all nearly identical in their chemical composition.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Albumen</span>, made from Eggs
and from Blood.&nbsp; It forms about 7 parts in 100 of <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>blood, and is
always present in lymph and chyle.&nbsp; Liquid or soluble
albumen, as shown in the white of egg, coagulates by heat and
various chemical agents.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Albumen</span>, as found in the
juices of carrots, turnips, and cabbages, and obtained by boiling
their juices.&nbsp; It is the same body as albumen from eggs.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Fibrin</span> made by stirring
blood with a rod.&nbsp; It is the basis of muscle or flesh.&nbsp;
Flesh-fibrin probably bears the same relation to blood-fibrin as
coagulated albumen does to soluble albumen.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Fibrin</span> made from
Wheat-flour.&nbsp; It is identical with the fibrin found in
flesh, but not exactly the same as that found in blood, and is
known as <i>Gluten</i>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Casein</span> prepared from milk,
in which it is soluble, owing probably to a little alkali: when
an acid is added, the Casein curdles or coagulates, and then is
known as Cheese.&nbsp; In 100 parts of cows&rsquo; milk there are
3&frac12; parts of Casein.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Casein</span> or <span
class="smcap">Legumin</span> as found in peas, beans, lentils,
coffee, &amp;c.&nbsp; The Casein of Vegetables is now supposed by
most chemists to be identical with the Casein or Cheese of Milk,
but a few chemists still deny this.&nbsp; 100 parts of peas
contain above 20 parts of Casein.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Eggs</span>.</h4>
<p>Eggs are very nutritious articles of food.&nbsp; They contain
as much oil or fat and flesh and force-producing matter as
butcher&rsquo;s meat.&nbsp; The white is not, however, so
digestible as the flesh of meat.&nbsp; They enter into the
composition of puddings, cakes, buns, and other forms of
diet.&nbsp; They are also eaten alone, boiled or fried, and are
most digestible when least done.</p>
<p>The egg of the domestic fowl is usually eaten, but those of
other birds are frequently employed as food.&nbsp; The eggs of
the woodcock, plover, and other small birds, are esteemed a
luxury.&nbsp; Those of the duck and goose have a strong flavour,
and those of sea-fowl are fishy.&nbsp; The eggs of the turkey are
rich in flavour, whilst those of the guinea-hen have a very
delicate flavour.&nbsp; All birds&rsquo; eggs may be eaten with
impunity.&nbsp; The eggs of the crocodile, and other oviparous
reptiles, are eaten in some parts of the world.</p>
<p>In Case <b>61</b> is a collection of the Eggs of domestic
poultry and some other birds, together with the analysis of
Hen&rsquo;s Eggs.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Flesh and Force-producers are most abundant in those
plants which yield the substantive food of man.&nbsp; These
plants belong principally to the group of cereal grasses, as
wheat, oats, barley, &amp;c., and leguminous plants, as peas,
beans, lentils, &amp;c.&nbsp; Of these the most important is
wheat.&nbsp; At the western end of the gallery are shown samples
of many cultivated varieties of wheat, oats, barley, rye, and
maize, in the straw, and in grain.</p>
<p>The Flesh and Force-producers exist also in large quantities
in milk, and in the flesh of vertebrate animals, divided into
mammals, birds, fishes, and reptiles.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Wheat</span>.</h4>
<p>The wheat plant is grown all over the world, but flourishes
mostly between the parallels of 25 and 60 degrees of
latitude.&nbsp; It is more abundant in the northern than in the
southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>The varieties of wheat cultivated in Europe may be divided
into those whose flowers produce awns, and those without these
appendages, or <i>bearded</i> and <i>beardless</i> wheats.&nbsp;
The fruits or seeds of these varieties are red or white, hence a
further subdivision takes place into <i>red</i> or <i>white</i>,
bearded or beardless, wheats.&nbsp; Amongst the red bearded
varieties is the fingered Egyptian or Mummy Wheat, which presents
the peculiarity of several branches bearing fruits proceeding
from its central stalk.&nbsp; Wheat is also called hard and soft
according to its consistence, and winter and spring as it is sown
at those seasons of the year.&nbsp; The red varieties yield the
largest amount of grain, but the white the whitest flour.</p>
<p>Wheat is preferred to the other cereal grasses as an article
of food on account of its containing a larger quantity of
flesh-forming matters.&nbsp; The flour also may be rendered very
white by separating it from the husks, or bran, and the fruit is
much more easily separated from the chaff than is the case with
the other cereals.&nbsp; The proportion of flesh and
force-producing to those of force-producers only, is more nearly
adjusted to the requirements of the system in wheat than in any
other food.&nbsp; Hence, probably, its very general use as an
article of food amongst the populations of the hardest working
nations in the world.</p>
<p>In Case <b>26</b> is an analysis of the various constituents
found in a pound of wheaten flour.</p>
<p>The chemical analysis of barley, buckwheat, maize, millet,
oats, rye, and rice may be inspected in the respective cases.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Bread</span>.</h4>
<p>The most common as well as the most important form in which
wheaten flour is consumed as food is bread.&nbsp; In Case
<b>25</b>, which may be called the &ldquo;Bread Case,&rdquo; the
constituent ingredients, with their respective quantities used in
making bread, are exhibited.&nbsp; There are three methods of
making bread, the <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>ordinary or fermented process, the unfermented process,
and that employed in making a&euml;rated bread.&nbsp; Bread is
either <i>vesiculated</i> or <i>unvesiculated</i>, the latter is
called unleavened bread, and consists of bread, and of such
preparations of flour as are known by the names of biscuits,
cakes, &amp;c. of which two cases of samples are shown by Messrs.
Peek, Frean, and Co. of London, and J. W. Mackie and Sons of
Edinburgh.&nbsp; For other details concerning bread the visitor
is referred to the printed labels in the case.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Animal Food or Flesh</span>.</h4>
<p>According to the classification of the Food Collection, Flesh
is placed next to Wheat and other cereals in Group 3, which
includes <i>nitrogenous substances capable of producing both
flesh and force</i>.</p>
<p>Animal food is composed of the same materials as vegetable
food.&nbsp; It is formed of the same elements, and presents the
same proximate principles.&nbsp; It contains water and mineral
matters of the same kind as plants.&nbsp; Its force-producing
substances appear in the form of fat, and its flesh and
force-producing substances in the form of fibrin and albumen.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Milk</span>.</h4>
<p>Of all animal foods milk is the most important, as it may be
regarded as the type of human food.&nbsp; Case <b>55</b> contains
an analysis of cow&rsquo;s milk, human milk, and asses milk, and
is accompanied with explanatory labels.</p>
<p>Milk is preserved in various ways, so that it may be taken on
long voyages or otherwise employed as a diet where living animals
cannot be kept to produce it.&nbsp; It is preserved both in a
liquid and solid state.&nbsp; The latter mode of preparation
appears to have the advantage.</p>
<p>Butter is formed from cream by the process of
&ldquo;churning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The casein is held in solution in
the milk by the aid of certain salts; when these are removed by
acids the casein coagulates, and forms &ldquo;curds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When the curd is removed with the butter and pressed it forms
cheese.&nbsp; The best and highest-priced cheeses are those in
which there is most butter.&nbsp; The casein without the butter
is hard and indigestible.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Flesh of Animals</span>.</h4>
<p>At the western end of the gallery over the upright cases
containing wheat, barley, oats, maize, &amp;c., are arranged some
selected heads of oxen in illustration of the principal breeds in
this country.</p>
<p>The Case, <b>56</b>, is specially devoted to the composition
of one pound of beef, mutton, pork, veal, lamb, and fowl.&nbsp;
Wax models represent the substances, and each analysis is
accompanied with descriptive printed labels.</p>
<p>In Case <b>70</b> are seen mounted specimens of the varieties
of hares and rabbits indigenous to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The flesh of birds, fish, and reptiles is also represented in
the Collection.</p>
<p>Cases <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> contain mounted examples of the
varieties of pheasant successfully introduced into Great Britain,
and a series of grouse, ptarmigan, capercailzie, &amp;c., as
representing the game birds of that family.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> is represented in the
Collection by mounted specimens of the commoner kinds of fish
brought to market, and by the analysis of a pound of salmon,
mackerel, sole, conger eel, herring, and pike.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span> yield a larger number of
species used as food by man than either birds or
quadrupeds.&nbsp; There are but few fishes caught in the fresh
waters and seas of Great Britain that may not be eaten with
impunity.&nbsp; In some countries the only animal food known is
fish.&nbsp; The flesh of fish contains less oil or fat, and a
larger quantity of mineral matters than the flesh of birds or
mammals.&nbsp; The digestibility of fish is not so great as that
of butcher&rsquo;s meat; hence, generally, it is not so
nutritious as the flesh of birds or quadrupeds.&nbsp; Fish is
undoubtedly a valuable as well as an agreeable article of diet,
and should, where possible, be introduced into all dietaries.</p>
<p>In connexion with fish the collection illustrating Economic
Fish Culture, mainly belonging to, and superintended by, Mr.
Frank Buckland, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspector of Salmon
Fisheries, should not be left unmentioned, although not forming a
part of the Food Collection in the Branch Museum at Bethnal
Green.&nbsp; This collection illustrates the science of breeding
salmon, trout, and other fish by artificial means.&nbsp; It also
includes a large number of casts of different kinds of fish, and
a series of nets and other apparatus used in the legal and
illegal capture of fish.&nbsp; At present it is exhibited in the
arcades on the western side of the Royal Horticultural Gardens at
South Kensington.&nbsp; During the period of the International
Exhibition it is not accessible except to visitors to the
Exhibition; but when the Exhibition is not going on, visitors can
see the Museum of Economic Fish Culture under the rules and
regulations which govern the South Kensington Museum, with which
it is officially connected as an addition to the Food
Collection.</p>
<p>Lobsters, crabs, prawns, and shrimps, are exhibited in the
collection in illustration of the edible animals belonging to the
crustacea; and of molluscous animals, embracing the shell fish of
the rivers and oceans, examples <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>of the oyster, scallop, whelk,
periwinkle, common snail, and Roman snail, are shown.&nbsp; (See
Cases <b>59</b> and <b>60</b>.)</p>
<p>Of reptiles, but few are eaten in this country as food.&nbsp;
Their flesh is, however, white and delicate, and rich in gelatin
and fat.&nbsp; No accurate analysis seems to have been published
of the flesh of these animals.&nbsp; The flesh of the green
turtle is consumed in considerable quantity, and of it the famous
turtle soup is made.&nbsp; The common and edible frog are eaten
on the continent; and the land tortoise, common on the coast of
the Mediterranean, is eaten by the inhabitants of Italy and the
Levant.&nbsp; The flesh of the crocodile, alligator, and iguana,
is also consumed in the countries where such creatures
abound.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Peas</span>, <span
class="smcap">Beans</span>, <span class="smcap">and
Cheese</span>.</h4>
<p>These substances are next in the order of classification by
reason of the large quantity of a flesh and force-producing
substance contained in them called <i>casein</i>.&nbsp; The
casein of vegetables is now supposed by most chemists to be
identical with the casein or cheese of milk.&nbsp; The
constituents or ingredients in one pound of peas, and in one
pound of beans, are shown in Cases <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>.&nbsp;
The visitor may examine a collection of beans from various
foreign countries arranged in the Cases at the western end of the
Collection.</p>
<p>Lentils are shown in Case <b>30</b>.&nbsp; By examining the
analysis of this extremely nutritious product, the large
proportion of casein is at once perceived.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Class</span> II.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Medicinal or Auxiliary</span>.</h3>
<p>The Food Substances in this Class are divided into <i>four</i>
groups, namely:&mdash;Those containing alcohol, those containing
volatile oils, those containing acids, and those containing
alkaloids, which act upon the nervous system as stimulants or
sedatives.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Beer</span>.</h4>
<p>The most common form in which alcohol is employed in this
country is that of beer.&nbsp; Beer is distinguished from other
alcoholic beverages by the addition of hops, which are the female
catkins of a plant extensively grown in this country.&nbsp; Case
<b>35</b> contains the materials from which porter is brewed, and
illustrates the changes which malt undergoes during its
conversion into beer.&nbsp; The analysis of stout, porter, pale
ale, mild ale, and strong ale are exhibited in Case <b>35</b>,
and the quantities of water, alcohol, sugar, and acetic acid are
shown in an imperial pint of each.&nbsp; Next to beer the
beverages containing alcohol consumed in this country are
wines.&nbsp; The visitor is referred to the printed descriptive
labels for details concerning the sources and manufacture of
various wines from the juice of fruits, especially grapes.&nbsp;
In Case <b>36</b> the quantities of water, alcohol, sugar, and
tartaric acid, are shown in an imperial pint of the following
wines:&mdash;Port, Brown Sherry, Pale Sherry, Claret, Burgundy,
Hock, Moselle, Champagne, and Madeira.</p>
<p>In this country wines are made from oranges, raisins,
gooseberries, currants, elderberries, and other fruits.&nbsp;
They are usually called &ldquo;home-made&rdquo; or
&ldquo;British&rdquo; wines.&nbsp; They contain other acids
besides tartaric, hence the necessity of adding to them large
quantities of sugar to cover the taste of the acid.&nbsp; Samples
of British wines are exhibited in the Collection.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Distilled Spirits</span>.</h4>
<p>The terms &ldquo;distilled&rdquo; and &ldquo;ardent&rdquo;
spirits are applied to alcoholic beverages which contain a very
large per-centage of alcohol.</p>
<p>Those most commonly used are Gin, Rum, Whisky, and Brandy.</p>
<p>Alcoholic drinks when taken into the stomach act injuriously
upon the mucous membrane, and when absorbed into the blood excite
the nervous system.&nbsp; When taken in too large quantities, or
upon an empty stomach, they lay the foundation of diseases of the
stomach and surrounding organs, which often terminate in
death.&nbsp; Their action on the nervous system, though pleasant
and agreeable, and even healthful in small quantities, becomes a
source of fearful disease when carried to excess.</p>
<p>It is difficult to procure alcohol pure, and distilled spirits
always contain a certain quantity of water.&nbsp; A spirit having
a density of .920 is called &ldquo;proof spirit&rdquo; in this
country; and when distilled spirits contain more or less alcohol
than this, they are said to be &ldquo;<i>under</i>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<i>above</i>&rdquo; proof.</p>
<p>The quantities of alcohol, water, and sugar in an imperial
pint of Brandy, Rum, and Gin, are shown in the Case
<b>39</b>.</p>
<p>The physical degeneracy and moral degradation attendant upon
taking alcohol in excess are well known; and no language is too
strong to condemn the folly and wickedness of those who thus
convert one of the blessings of Providence into a curse.</p>
<p>In Cases <b>38</b> the visitor will see samples of alcohol
obtained from various sources; also a variety of flavored
spirits, or &ldquo;liqueurs,&rdquo; from various countries, and a
Japanese spirit or liqueur, distilled from rice, called
&ldquo;soke,&rdquo; or &ldquo;saki.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Volatile Oils</span>.</h4>
<p>There is a large class of substances which are added to food
for the purpose of giving it flavour, and which on account of the
volatile <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>oils they contain act as stimulants.&nbsp; These
substances are known as Spices and Condiments.&nbsp; They also
serve as the basis of a large number of sauces, which are sold
ready prepared for the purpose of being added to cooked
food.&nbsp; There is some difficulty in separating Spices from
Condiments, but the former are more generally eaten with sugar,
the latter with salt.</p>
<p>In Cases <b>40</b> to <b>43</b> will be found an extensive
series of Spices and Condiments from various parts of the
world.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Flavorers</span>.</h4>
<p>There is another class of substances, which cannot be called
either condiments or spices, but which are extensively employed
to render the taste of food more agreeable.&nbsp; Among these may
be noticed (see Case <b>44</b>) oil of bitter almonds, vanilla,
lemon, orange, and citron peel.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting discoveries of modern chemistry is
the nature of those essences which give the various flavours to
fruits.&nbsp; These &ldquo;artificial fruit essences&rdquo; have
been so skilfully imitated in the laboratory of the chemist that
they are extensively employed to flavour confectionery,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Examples of these artificially prepared fruit
essences, may be seen in the case.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Acids</span>.</h4>
<p>Many of the organic acids resemble closely in their
composition starch and sugar, and may to a certain extent act on
the system in the same way.&nbsp; In the classification adopted
in the Food Collection, they are classed under <i>medicinal or
auxiliary food</i>.</p>
<p><i>Acetic Acid or Vinegar</i> is obtained either from the
oxidation of alcohol in fermented liquors, or from the
distillation of wood.&nbsp; Common vinegar is obtained from the
oxidation of the fermented wort of malt.&nbsp; A series of
preparations illustrating the processes undergone in the
formation of vinegar from malt has been presented to the
collection by Messrs. Beaufoy and Co.</p>
<p><i>Citric Acid</i> is contained in many fruits, but exists in
greatest abundance and purity in the fruits of the orange, the
lemon, the citron, the shaddock, the pommeloe, the lime, and
others.&nbsp; All these fruits contain citric acid, and varying
proportions of sugar.&nbsp; Citric acid can be separated from the
juice of these plants in a crystalline form.</p>
<p><i>Tartaric Acid</i> is found in the juice of the fruits of
the vine tribe, more especially of the common vine.&nbsp; This
acid gives the acidity to the fruit of the grape, and is the acid
present in wines.</p>
<p><i>Malic Acid</i> is contained in the fruits of the natural
order Rosace&aelig;.&nbsp; It has the same general properties as
the other acids, and is contained alone in apples and pears;
whilst in cherries, plums, &amp;c. it is mixed with other
acids.</p>
<p><i>Oxalic Acid</i> is contained in the wood sorrel, also in
the common sorrel, and various species of rhubarb.&nbsp; Species
of the latter genus are extensively cultivated in this country,
and the stalks of their large leaves cut up and made into pies,
puddings, &amp;c.&nbsp; They are ready for use early in the
spring, and are an excellent substitute for fruit in pies and
tarts at that season of the year.&nbsp; Although oxalic acid is a
<i>poison</i> when taken in considerable quantities, as
ordinarily consumed it probably acts in the same way on the
system as other acids.</p>
<p>For examples of Acids, Pickles of various kinds, &amp;c., see
Case <b>23</b>.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Alkaloids acting as Stimulants or
Sedatives</span>.</h4>
<p>The next and last group is that of Food Substances containing
alkaloids, which act upon the nervous system as stimulants or
sedatives.&nbsp; The principal examples are Tea, Coffee, Cocoa,
Tobacco, Hemp, and Opium.</p>
<p>Tea and Coffee have hardly any other properties in common than
the possession of an alkaloid called <i>Theine</i> or
<i>Caffeine</i>, which is identical in the two.&nbsp; Chocolate
contains a peculiar alkaloid called <i>Theobromine</i>.&nbsp;
Paraguay tea or &ldquo;mat&eacute;&rdquo; is the only other
substance extensively used as a dietetic infusion that contains
<i>theine</i>; in South America it occupies the same position in
domestic economy as Chinese tea does in this country.&nbsp; Case
<b>46</b> exhibits the chemical analysis of a pound of ordinary
good Chinese Tea; and in Cases <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, and
<b>99</b>, contiguously placed, are numerous samples of tea from
China, Japan, Java, Brazil, and East India.</p>
<p>The analysis of a pound of Coffee is shown in Case <b>50</b>;
and many samples of raw coffee from various parts of the world
are exhibited.&nbsp; The visitor&rsquo;s notice is directed to
the printed descriptive label concerning Coffee, which is
suspended near the case containing the analysis.</p>
<p><i>Cocoa</i> is represented by the analysis of a pound of
Cocoa paste in Case <b>53</b>, and by a series of the fruit pods
containing the seed or nuts, presented by Messrs. Fry and Son, of
Bristol, as well as by various preparations and
confections.&nbsp; The distinguishing feature of its composition
consists in the large quantities of fat and albumen which it
contains; so that Cocoa not only acts as an alternative through
its <i>theobromine</i>, but as a force-producing and flesh <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>and
force-producing food.&nbsp; Samples of the commercial varieties
of the nuts or seeds from various countries are exhibited.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Tea and Coffee Substitutes</span>.</h4>
<p>A variety of substances are exhibited in Case <b>49</b> in
illustration of the use of the leaves of various plants for
making potable infusions.&nbsp; The most important is Paraguay
tea or &ldquo;mat&eacute;,&rdquo; which contains the same
alkaloid called <i>theine</i>, as the Chinese tea plant.&nbsp; A
quantity of &ldquo;mat&eacute;&rdquo; is shown, with calabash or
dried gourd for making the infusion, and sucking pipe for
drinking it.&nbsp; A large number of substances have been
employed from time to time as substitutes for Coffee, and
prepared in the same way.&nbsp; Many of them are shown in Case
<b>52</b>.&nbsp; In this country none of these so-called Coffee
Substitutes have established themselves in public reputation, and
are seldom sold.&nbsp; Some of them, however, are used as
adulterants of Coffee.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Tobacco</span>.</h4>
<p>Although Tobacco has been only comparatively recently
introduced amongst the inhabitants of the Old World, it is more
extensively employed than any other narcotic.&nbsp; It is the
produce of various species of the genus <i>Nicotiana</i>.&nbsp;
The practice of smoking the leaves of these plants was introduced
from the New World.&nbsp; The species, which is a native of
America, and which supplies the greater proportion of the Tobacco
smoked in Europe, is the <i>Nicotiana Tabacum</i>.&nbsp; The
leaves of these plants contain an active and highly poisonous
principle called <i>Nicotine</i>, which is the agent that
produces the narcotic effect experienced in smoking.&nbsp; This
narcotic effect resembles in some measure that of alcohol.&nbsp;
Tobacco has, however, a less stimulant effect than alcohol, and
produces, especially at first, a greater derangement of the
general nervous system.</p>
<p>The chemical analysis of one pound of Tobacco is exhibited in
Case <b>98</b>.&nbsp; Cases <b>93</b> to <b>97</b> contain a
series of specimens of the leaves of species and varieties of
Tobacco cultivated in various parts of the world, with samples
also of the Cigars and Tobaccos manufactured from them.</p>
<p>Examples of varieties of Snuffs used in this and other
countries will be seen in Case <b>97</b>.&nbsp; Snuffs are
usually made from the stalks and ribs of tobacco leaves.&nbsp;
Tobacco is liable to be adulterated with the leaves of other
plants; these, however, can be detected under the
microscope.&nbsp; Specimens of Tobacco adulterated with other
leaves are illustrated in the diagram near the cases.</p>
<p>Opium is used extensively as a medicine, on account of its
power of alleviating pain and inducing sleep.&nbsp; It is a very
powerful, and consequently dangerous narcotic poison, and should
never be taken except under medical advice.&nbsp; In small doses
it acts as a stimulant.&nbsp; On account of this latter property
and its subsequent soothing influence, it has been indulged in by
man, and is consumed largely in China and other parts of the
world as a dietetical luxury.&nbsp; When taken for this purpose
it is smoked, and is generally consumed with tobacco or some
other leaf in a pipe.&nbsp; Pipes used for this purpose in China
are exhibited in the cases containing Chinese food, with a
collection of Chinese tobaccos, most of which appear to contain
Opium.</p>
<p>The practice of &ldquo;opium eating,&rdquo; as it is called,
exerts a most prejudicial effect upon the system; and although
not rapidly destroying life, the victim of this habit is after a
time rendered perfectly miserable if not able to procure this
indulgence.&nbsp; As is the case with alcohol and tobacco, the
system becomes accustomed to the use of this narcotic, and
prodigious quantities have been consumed by those who have
addicted themselves to the practice of taking it for the sake of
its effect on the system.</p>
<p>A series of preparations from Opium, presented by the Society
of Apothecaries, Apothecaries Hall, and specimens of other
narcotic agents are exhibited in Case <b>92</b>.&nbsp; The fruits
of narcotic plants are sometimes consumed in this country in
mistake for other plants, producing fatal effects.&nbsp; Examples
of some of these poisonous plants are exhibited in the
Collection, as well as diagrams of others.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Before closing this necessarily brief Guide to the Food
Collection, it may be as well to notice some illustrations which
may be deemed exceptional to the Classification.</p>
<p><i>Fungi</i>.&mdash;The group of Fungi contains a number of
plants which are eaten as food, whilst many of them act as
virulent poisons.&nbsp; Those which are edible contain varying
quantities of starch, sugar, woody fibre, and albumen, together
with an acid called <i>fungic</i> acid.&nbsp; A large number of
species are eaten on the continent of Europe, which are not used
in this country at all.&nbsp; Models of the common Mushroom, the
Morel, and the Truffle, are shown, as well as preserved
specimens.</p>
<p>The visitor should notice the large Truffle from Australia
called &ldquo;Native Bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in Case
<b>34</b>.</p>
<p>A series of coloured diagrams or drawings of British Fungi
taken from living specimens, both edible and poisonous, are also
exhibited, having been purchased from the artist, H. Worthington
Smith, Esq., F.L.S.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span><i>National Foods</i>.&mdash;Various food products of
foreign nations are included in the Collection, and for the sake
of illustrating <i>National Food</i> have been kept
separate.&nbsp; It is hoped that other collections of the same
kind, illustrating <i>national peculiarities of diet</i> may be
formed and presented to the Museum.</p>
<p>In Cases <b>72</b> to <b>78</b> is an important collection of
Chinese Food, which was received in 1859.&nbsp; The collection
was procured from two districts, Shanghae and Foo-Chow-Foo, and
contains many curious and interesting edible substances and
preparations, some of them new to this country.&nbsp; Descriptive
labels are attached to every specimen.</p>
<p>Japanese, Siamese, and East Indian food products are shown in
Cases <b>81</b> to <b>86</b>.</p>
<p>In Case <b>79</b> will be noticed a series of <i>edible
birds&rsquo; nests</i> from China, Siam, Java, Borneo, and other
countries.&nbsp; These nests are formed by swallows, two specimen
of which are shown in the case.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Economic Entomology applied to Food and
Forestry</span>.</h4>
<p>This Collection, formed and arranged for the Department of
Science and Art by Andrew Murray, Esq., F.L.S., is exhibited at
the eastern end of the gallery, partly on the wall, and partly in
glazed cases on the counter.&nbsp; It is intended to illustrate
the ravages of such insects as are known to be destructive to
alimentary substances, or that are noxious or injurious to man
and domestic animals.&nbsp; Also, those insects known to be
destructive to timber, or otherwise exemplifying the science of
Entomology in its relation to Forestry.&nbsp; The Collection is
contained in <b>42</b> cases, to which belong <b>31</b> framed
diagrams and drawings.&nbsp; This Entomological Collection is yet
incomplete, and may be considered as still in course of
formation.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Adulteration of Food</span>.</h4>
<p>The extensive employment of various substances for the
Adulteration of Food has led to the formation of a collection of
those more commonly employed.&nbsp; In Cases <b>97</b> and
<b>98</b> these substances are arranged according as they have
been obtained from the animal, vegetable, or mineral
kingdom.&nbsp; They have been selected principally from the
results obtained by Dr. Hassall, and made known in his work
&ldquo;On the Adulteration of Food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The adulteration of <i>Milk</i> with <i>Water</i> is shown in
Case <b>54</b>.&nbsp; These examples are renewed weekly; and the
use of the <i>lactometer</i> or <i>milk measurer</i>, is also
exemplified in the same case.&nbsp; The goodness of milk can also
be ascertained by means of the microscope.&nbsp; The diagrams on
the wall represent good cream, good pure milk, bad milk, and the
curd of milk as seen under the microscope.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
